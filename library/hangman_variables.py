# Hangman Variables
# This is a module that contains the variables for the hangman game implemented in Python.
# The module is imported by the hangman_module module, which is used to determine the words for the game and the hangman ASCII art.

# First I create a list of easy words for the user to guess in the hangman game.
easy = ["code", "game", "python", "list", "loop", "string", "variable", "function", "class", "import"]
# Then I create a list of medium words for the user to guess in the hangman game.
medium = ["program", "algorithm", "database", "software", "hardware", "browser", "network", "keyboard", "monitor", "terminal"]
# Then I create a list of hard words for the user to guess in the hangman game.
hard = ["javascript", "framework", "repository", "encryption", "artificial", "blockchain", "cybersecurity", "machinelearning"]

# Then I create a list of ASCII art for the hangman game.
